Next Steps for Gradient Descent
delta w (change in the weights)= -  n (learning rate) the gradient which is a vector operator on the cost funciton C or L for loss function.

Two things to play with
1. which direction (direction)
2. how far, how many steps (magnitude)

Convolutional Nerual Networks

Correlation in CNN
Feature Extractor ==> Classification
Features are extracted by doing correlation although it is called convolution.
